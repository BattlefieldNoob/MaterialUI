MaterialUI is a UI kit for Unity that follows Google's official Material Design guidelines.

This plugin was initially developed by [Invex Games](http://www.invexgames.com/) as opensource project, then it become an paid plugin and reached Unity Asset Store (was available [here](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/gui/materialui-51870), actually the plugin is deprecated and cannot be buyed anymore).

The idea of this fork is to maintain the opensource version of MaterialUI (which has less components implemented) and trying to align the plugin with the paid version and also develop a UI Elements (now UI Toolkit) version

Because i've buyed the complete plugin, i've tried to contact Invex Games and talk to them to make the complete version opensource, but at today they didn't reply me

Any issue/pull request/discussion is welcome and encouraged
